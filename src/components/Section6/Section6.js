            We've worked on many projects together with Brooke at Stilltech, and
            she's a true asset to any team. She's a team player, but think on
            her feet and never settles for a no. Her ambition and passion for
            what she does is uncanny, and it's been a pleasure to see her
            progress and grow more confident in her professional role over time.
            I thoroughly recommend her for any leadership or project management
            roles.

            Brooke was my manager at Yeall & Co and taught me everything I know
            about project management. As an intern, she never treated me
            differently from other team members – instead, she whole-heartedly
            embraced my ideas and input. She helped me to think about the bigger
            picture and implement strategy into my everyday work, but also
            showed me how to bring people together and unite them for a single
            goal.
